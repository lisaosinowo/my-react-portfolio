                     I am Lisa, a Software Enginner (and Chemical Engineering
                     graduate).

                  <p className="about-info">
                     My Chemical Engineering degree is where my problem solving
                     and innovation skills stemmed from. After obtaining my
                     degree I decided to transition into the tech world where I
                     initially taught myself how to code with Python. In October
                     2024, I obtained a Frontend Development Fundamentals
                     certificate after completing my Frontend Development
                     bootcamp. Within the bootcamp, I learned HTML and CSS. Now
                     I am learning JavaScript and React to further equip myself
                     with the skills needed for Frontend Development.

                     In January 2025 I started a 16-week CFGdegree in
                     Fullstack Development with a +Masters in Cyber Security
                     with Code First Girls. This course included HTML, CSS,
                     JavaScript, React, TypeScript and Angular.

                     I am known to be a resilient and determinted character who
                     doesn't shy away from complex problems/tasks. I am always
                     up for a challenge which also fuels my coding confidence.
